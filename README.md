### **Hotel Performance Dashboard**

- Scenario:
  AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20
  years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are
  losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing
  director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and
  revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. For that
  reason, their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party
  service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

  Working as a Data Analyst, my task is to transform these records into a interactive dashboard and meaningful
  insights that others can use to track and drive their action.

- Key Tasks:

  1. Cleaning and Pre-processing (Power Query):
     - Utilize Power Query to clean and preprocess raw data, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
     - Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies for a robust dataset.
       
  2. Layout Designing:
     - Create an aesthetically pleasing layout for the dashboard, incorporating charts and graphs.
     - Use visualizations to provide an overview of hotel performance, focusing on key metrics.
     - Leverage DAX functions for intricate calculations, enhancing the depth of analysis.

  3. Competitor Research:
     - Conduct thorough research on competitors in the luxury/business hotels category.
     - Identify their strategies, strengths, and weaknesses to inform AtliQ Grands' decision-making.

  4. Industry Comparisons: We Vs Others:
     - Compare AtliQ Grands' performance metrics with industry benchmarks and competitors.
     - Provide a detailed analysis highlighting areas of improvement and competitive advantages.

  5. Provide Insight: Pros and Cons
     - Extract actionable insights from the data, emphasizing strengths and weaknesses.
     - Present pros and cons based on performance metrics, customer reviews, and industry standards.

  6. Presentation:
     - Develop a comprehensive presentation to communicate insights effectively.
     - Utilize visuals, charts, and graphs to convey key findings and recommendations.

  7. Suggestion:
     - Provide strategic suggestions based on the analysis to enhance market share and revenue.
     - Outline actionable steps and recommendations for the management team to implement.

- Expected Outcomes:
  
  The Hotel Performance Dashboard project aims to empower AtliQ Grands with data-driven insights, enabling them to
  make informed decisions and regain their market share. By incorporating DAX for advanced logic and calculations
  alongside data cleaning, layout design, competitor research, industry comparisons, insightful analysis, effective
