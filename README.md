### **Hotel Performance Dashboard**

- Scenario:
  AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20
  years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are
  losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing
  director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and
  revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. For that
  reason, their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party
  service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

  Working as a Data Analyst, my task is to transform these records into a interactive dashboard and meaningful
  insights that others can use to track and drive their action.

- Key Tasks:

  1. Cleaning and Pre-processing (Power Query):
     - Utilize Power Query to clean and preprocess raw data, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
     - Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies for a robust dataset.
