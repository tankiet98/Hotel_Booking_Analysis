### **Hotel Performance Tracking Dashboard**

- Scenario:
  AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and
  revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team
  to provide them with these insights. For that reason, their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

  Working as a Data Analyst, my task is to transform these records into a interactive dashboard and meaningful insights that others can use to track and drive their action.
